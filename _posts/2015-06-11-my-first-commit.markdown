  So finally, I decided to create my own website. I'm aware that writing is one of my weakness.
  Making a good writing is hard and it need a lot of practices. Here, I will try to write
  as much as possible and I hope I can get better in writing :)

  Most things that I plan to write here will be related to technical stuffs. But I plan to write
  some non technical stuff too. Wish me luck !
